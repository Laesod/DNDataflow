= DevNexus Spring Cloud Data Flow Workshop

This repository contains the presentations and lab materials for the Spring Cloud Data Flow workshop for DevNexus.

== Preparation for the class

Please be sure before attending the class make sure you have the following items installed on the laptop you are bringing to class.

1. Maven
2. Java 8
3. Text Editor or IDE (Labs can be done with a text editor and command line)
4. RabbitMQ.  If not already installed we have instructions provided to you here for MacOSX and Windows installation.

While internet is provided by DevNexus usually there is a large spike in internet usage in the mornings of the workshops, so we ask that you download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server and Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell before class.
